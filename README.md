# Steam Manifest Hub

**Steam Manifest Hub** is a versatile tool designed to generate and download Steam application manifests using an App ID. It integrates directly with the [ManifestHub Database](https://github.com/SteamAutoCracks/ManifestHub/) to retrieve data, primarily for use with tools like SteamTools.

This repository offers two ways to use the tool: a robust **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and a modern **Web Interface**.

## 🚀 Features

* **Web Interface**: A responsive HTML5/Tailwind CSS interface for easy access via a browser.
* **Automated Checks**: Instantly validates AppIDs against the ManifestHub database via the GitHub API.
* **Direct Downloads**: Generates direct download links for manifest files.


### Web Interface

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

1. Click "I Understand & Accept The Risks" on the disclaimer modal.
2. Enter the AppID in the input field.
3. Click **CHECK MANIFEST** to search.
4. If found, a download button will appear.
